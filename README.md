## Description
This is a wrapper for the official `openshift-install` binary to perform IPI (Installer Provided Infrastructure) installations of OpenShift 4.

Features:
 - downloads the installer and client for the desired version
 - creates sample cloud credential files in the right location for each cloud provider
 - creates install-config.yaml for each cloud provider
 - allows customize a previously installed cluster with some pre-made scripts
 - includes client wrappers to use any of them based on environment variables
 
## Preparation
The wrapper leverages in `openshift-install` all the tasks but it requires some pre-requisites:
  - proper credentials for every cloud provider
  - RSA key
  - pull secret

### Script installation
This will copy the script to the default location `$HOME/.local/ocp4`:
```
$ make install         
```

For other locations set `TARGETDIR` at your convenience:
```
$ make TARGETDIR=/opt/ocp4 install         
```

Add the directory to your `$PATH` variable so you can invoke it directly:
```
$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/ocp4/bin
```

### Cloud credentials
If you don't have such credentials yet (ie. if you don't use aws-cli at all), you can invoke the wrapper for every platform so it will create the sample file and then proceed to edit it with your own credentials:
```
$ openshift-install-wrapper --init --platform aws
→ Validating environment...
→ Creating target directory...
→ Creating sample cloud credentials file for aws...
 ✔  Created sample file /home/sgarcia/.aws/credentials. Please edit it to add the proper credentials for each provider before trying to install any cluster or it will fail.
``` 

### Other files
- Copy the RSA public key that will be injected in the instances to `$HOME/.config/openshift-install-wrapper/config/ssh-key.pub`
- Copy the pull secret to `$HOME/.config/openshift-install-wrapper/config/pull-secret.json`

## Usage
The list of features and options is increasing as changes are made. Check the `--help` parameter for the newest list.

### Install a cluster
```
$ openshift-install-wrapper --install \
                            --name sgarcia-ocp447 \
                            --domain aws.gmbros.net \
                            --version 4.4.7 \
                            --platform aws \
                            --region eu-west-1
→ Validating environment...
→ Checking if installer for 4.4.7 is already present...
 ✔  Installer for 4.4.7 found. Continuing.
→ Checking if the cluster directory already exists...
→ Creating install-config.yaml file...
→ Running "openshift-install" to create a cluster...
 ✔  Cluster created!
To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/sgarcia/.local/ocp4/clusters/sgarcia-ocp447-3.aws.gmbros.net/auth/kubeconfig'
Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.sgarcia-ocp447.aws.gmbros.net
Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: m2MsJ-vKNcn-8zTHM-A9NVU
```

### Destroy a cluster
```
$ openshift-install-wrapper --destroy \
                            --name sgarcia-ocp447 \
                            --domain aws.gmbros.net
→ Validating environment...
→ Finding version in cluster directory...
 ✔  Version detected: 4.4.7.
→ Finding platform in cluster directory...
 ✔  Platform detected: aws.
→ Checking if installer for 4.4.7 is already present...
 ✔  Installer for 4.4.7 found. Continuing.
→ Running "openshift-install" to destroy a cluster...
 ✔  Cluster destroyed!
→ Removing directory...
```

### Customize a cluster
```
$ openshift-install-wrapper --customize delete-kubeadmin-user \
                            --name sgarcia-ocp447 \
                            --domain aws.gmbros.net
→ Validating environment...
→ Finding version in cluster directory...
 ✔  Version detected: 4.4.7.
→ Finding platform in cluster directory...
 ✔  Platform detected: aws.
→ Checking if client binaries for 4.4.7 are already present...
 ✔  Client binaries for 4.4.7 are found. Continuing.
→ Running delete-kubeadmin-user...
secret "kubeadmin" deleted
```

### Use/login into a cluster with default KUBECONFIG/kubeadmin
For login, use the script as usual:
```
$ openshift-install-wrapper --login \
                            --name sgarcia-ocp447 \
                            --domain aws.gmbros.net
````

For direct KUBECONFIG access, use the script with the $() syntax:
```
$ $( openshift-install-wrapper --use \
                            --name sgarcia-ocp447 \
                            --domain aws.gmbros.net )
```

### Troubleshooting
- Use `--verbose` to get extra information during the execution, including the full output of `openshift-install`
- Review `$HOME/.local/ocp4/clusters/<cluster_name>/.openshift_install_wrapper.log` for useful output

## Client wrappers
Some helper wrappers will be installed in the target directory which will help to use the different versions of the tools (`openshift-install`, `oc` and `kubelet`) by using environment variables.

With this client wrappers you can move from one client version to another easily by setting the `$OCP4_VERSION` variable so the right binary will be used transparently without messing with PATH and/or alias for your commands.

All three wrappers will include some goodies:
 - will read the variable `$OCP4_VERSION` to change the final binary.
 - will read the variables `$OC_VERSION`, `$KUBELET_VERSION`, and `$OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_VERSION` respectively to change the final version, regardless `$OCP4_VERSION`, for individual testing.
 - add a `--wrapper-info` parameter to show the available versions for each one.

Example:
```sh
$ oc version
Client Version: 4.6.9

$ oc --wrapper-info
Wrapper info:
  - WRAPPER_NAME: oc
  - WRAPPER_VERSION: default
  - WRAPPER_BASEDIR: /home/sgarcia/.local/ocp4/bin

Available versions (for $OC_VERSION and/or $OCP4_VERSION):
  - 4.4.30
  - 4.5.16
  - 4.6.12
  - 4.6.9
  - default (4.6.9)

$ export OCP4_VERSION=4.6.12

$ oc version
Client Version: 4.6.12

$ kubectl version
Client Version: 4.6.12

$ openshift-install version
/home/sgarcia/.local/ocp4/bin/openshift-install-4.6.12 4.6.12
built from commit eded5eb5b6c77e2af2a2c537093da8bf3711f494
release image quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:5c3618ab914eb66267b7c552a9b51c3018c3a8f8acf08ce1ff7ae4bfdd3a82bd
```

## Adding customization scripts
In order to add new scripts, they must meet some requisites:
 - they must be created in the `scripts/` directory
 - they must have a descriptive name and do not overlap with any existing command or function in the system
 - optionally they can have a name and a description (single line)
 - they must contain some markers and a `main()` function. Use any existing script as a baseline or use this one:
   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash

   # Optional fields
   # script name: delete-kubeadmin-user
   # script description: Removes the kubeadmin secret

   # Mandatory function
   # start main - do not remove this line and do not change the function name
   main() {
     oc delete secret kubeadmin -n kube-system \
         && success "Secret kubeadmin successfully deleted." \
         || err "Error deleting kubeadmin secret. It probably doesn't exists anymore. Skipping."
   }
   # end main - do not remove this line

   # Optionally, keep this if you want to run your script manually or for testing.
   main $@
   ```

On the other hand, in order to provide flexibility, every script will receive the next parameters:
| Parameter  | Description  | Example  |
|:----------:|:-------------|:---------|
| `$1` | name of the customization and arguments in the command line | `deploy-rhsso=namespace=rhsso:version=4.2.2` |
| `$2` | full path to the cluster installation directory | `/opt/ocp4/clusters/sgarcia-ocp447/` |
| `$3` | full path to the right `oc` client binary | `/opt/ocp4/bin/oc-4.4.7` |
| `$4` | verbose mode flag (`0` or `1`) | `0` |
| `$5` | quiet mode flag (`0` or `1`) | `0` |
| `$6` | cluster version | `4.4.7` |
| `$7` | cluster name | `sgarcia-ocp447` |
| `$8` | cluster subdomain | `aws.gmbros.net` |
| `$9` | cloud platform | `aws` |

In the same way, there are a few functions ready to be used from the customizations:
 - `oc()`, which runs a command in the cluster with `system:admin` permissions and aligns the output with the `--verbose` flag
 - `success()`, which allows to print a message after succeeding in a command with a check icon
 - `err()`, which allows to print a message after failing in a command with a cross icon
 - `die()`, which allows to print a message after failing in a command with a cross icon and stops the execution
 - `parse_args_as_variables()`, which will parse an string and declare variables based on the content of it

Optionally, your customization can receive extra arguments sent in the commandline. This is useful if you customization is flexible 
in what it does or it allows different actions (like installing different versions of an operator). As an example:
```sh
$ openshift-install-wrapper --customize add-htpasswd-idp 
                            --name sgarciam-ocp447 \
                            --domain aws.gmbros.net
→ Validating environment...
→ Finding version in cluster directory...
 ✔  Version detected: 4.4.7.
→ Finding platform in cluster directory...
 ✔  Platform detected: aws.
→ Checking if client binaries for 4.4.7 are already present...
 ✔  Client binaries for 4.4.7 are found. Continuing.
→ Running add-htpasswd-idp...
 ✔  Adding default users: admin, user and guest.
 ✔  Secret htpasswd-secret created/configured successfully.
 ✔  OAuth/cluster successfully configured.

$ openshift-install-wrapper --customize add-htpasswd-idp=admin=adminpwd:user1=user1pwd
                            --name sgarciam-ocp447 \
                            --domain aws.gmbros.net
→ Validating environment...
→ Finding version in cluster directory...
 ✔  Version detected: 4.4.7.
→ Finding platform in cluster directory...
 ✔  Platform detected: aws.
→ Checking if client binaries for 4.4.7 are already present...
 ✔  Client binaries for 4.4.7 are found. Continuing.
→ Running add-htpasswd-idp...
 ✔  Using custom users.
 ✔  Adding user admin with password adminpwd.
 ✔  Adding user user1 with password user1pwd.
 ✔  Secret htpasswd-secret created/configured successfully.
 ✔  OAuth/cluster successfully configured.
```

Finally, after adding your new script in the directory, remember to run `make install` in order to install a new version of `openshift-install-wrapper` with your script embedded on it.

## TODO
- Read cluster version and cluster platform from install directory for `--customize`, and `--destroy` operations
- Add GCP support
- Improve `--list` output
- Improve console output (ie. include timestamps)
- Implement `--expire` parameter to delete (using cron) a cluster after a certain time

## Known issues
- Error handling when the cloud credentials are invalid or the installation fails
- Lines with # in customization scripts are removed during the merge. This must be fixed.
